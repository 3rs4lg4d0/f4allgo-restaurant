// Package domain includes DDD elements like aggregates, entities, value objects
// and domain events. Also domain services and factories can be included here if
// they are neccessary. However, repositories should not be included here to be
// consistent with the hexagonal architecture (repository interfaces should be
// defined as secondary ports and the implementations should be outside the core
// of the application).
